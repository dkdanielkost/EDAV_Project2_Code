Project 2 - Global Floods

Project 2 for the EDAV class in the Masters of Data Science at Columbia University. This project focused on global flood data from 1985-present. There were 4 contributors including myself, but my specific contribution was the choropleth map and interactive google map displaying the location of the floods.
